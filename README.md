Thoughts:
I approached this in a non structured way and jumped straight to wanting to do a 
css animation (rotating/changing words see: main profile).

This was hard to navigate as I was still trying to wrap my head on flexbox/media queries.

My branch, I tried to use a template and watched a youtuve video and still struggled to follow
and make the responsiveness correct.

Made a branch version 2, working in sections and trying to set the base and layout first 
before jumping into any major css styling.

This version is the one I'm happiest with, though in the 'skills' page, i am still
unable to mimic the responsiveness and footer in the index page.
